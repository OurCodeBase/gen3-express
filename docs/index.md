## Acknowledgements
You need to know atleast basics about these things.
 - [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/)
 - [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/en/5x/api.html)
 - [Embedded JS](https://ejs.co/)
 
## Installation
You can install and generate an express app using this tool in two approaches. Here I'm generating an app with name `my-app`, you can name to it anything you like.

### 1. node package extecutor
This method is highly recommended to generate an express app.
```bash
npx https://www.github.com/OurCodeBase/gen3-express my-app
```


### 2. node package manager
Generation of an express app is not recommended through npm.
```bash
npm install -gen3 https://www.github.com/OurCodeBase/gen3-express.git
```
```bash
gen3-express my-app
```

## Documentation
To install all dev dependencies goto the folder and hit `npm install` command.
```bash
cd my-app
npm install
```
To start a dev server to preview page use `server` word.
> [!NOTE]  
> This does not include EJS and static files live (hot) reloading.
```bash
npm run server
```
To start a dev server to live preview EJS page use `sync` word.
```bash
npm run sync
```
If you want to run all these servers together then you should to use this below command, this command will provide you hot reloadings in every place.
```bash
npm run server & npm run server
```
